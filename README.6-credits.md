Thanks to Jaakko Roppola for wonderful icon art!! ðŸ™Œ

Thanks to Jonatas Walker for his [jonataswalker/vue-rollup-example](https://github.com/jonataswalker/vue-rollup-example) template. Based this work on it, then changed a few things.

Thanks to Gaute Meek Olsen for his template and [associated blog entry](https://gaute.dev/dev-blog/vue-router-firebase-auth) (Nov '19). This taught me how to use a Promise with `firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged` properly.

Thanks to [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) for SVG icon art.

### Other app templates

- [Firelayer](https://firelayer.io)
  - seems visually pleasing!
  - likely Vue.js 2?
  - likely uses bundling

*tbd. When someone has checked Firelayer in detail, and can make a brief (2 sentence!) summary on how it differs from GroundLevel, that is a welcome #contribution!*
