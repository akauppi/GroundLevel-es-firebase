# vue-rollup-example-with-firebase-auth

Based on [jonataswalker/vue-rollup-example](https://github.com/jonataswalker/vue-rollup-example).

**Changes**

- Jonatas's code is unlicensed. This is MIT licensed.
- Simplified `package.json` a bit (an app template doesn't need to be exported)
- updated dependencies
- `package-lock.json` disabled (just a matter of taste...)
- added `dev` target for "watch" workflow
- using `public` as the public folder (Firebase Hosting default); `dist` and `index.html` moved there.
- targeting "evergreen" ([ES6 compatible](https://caniuse.com/#search=ES6%20modules), not IE11) browsers.
  - for IE11 support, add [@rollup/plugin-buble](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/buble) to `package.json` and `rollup.config.js`

The repo provides a non-project-specific template for bringing a web app online, with Vue, Rollup and Firebase authentication.

<!--
This template has been used in the following applications:

! Your application reference appreciated here; even if it were commercial and closed source, you may be able to share the name. :)
-->


## Requirements

- `npm`
- `firebase`
  - `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- `vue`
  - `npm install -g @vue/cli`

>Note: `@vue/cli` is the new version; `vue-cli` shown in some tutorials is the one it deprecates. Note: Vue CLI version 3 doesn't mean Vue version 3. You can use it to target Vue 2 as well. :)

### Firebase project

You need to:

- create a Firebase project
- enable hosting and authentication
  - you can choose the set of authentication providers you like (we use Google)
- `firebase login`
- `firebase use --add` to activate the project for this working directory

See [DEVS/Setting up a Firebase project.md](Setting up a Firebase project.md) for details.

>Note: `firebase use` when there's a cloned template like this; to create one you'd use `firebase init`.

<!-- Editor's note: no need to provide more details?...
-->
