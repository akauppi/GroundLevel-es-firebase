# vue-rollup-example-with-firebase-auth

Based on [jonataswalker/vue-rollup-example](https://github.com/jonataswalker/vue-rollup-example).

**Changes**

- Jonathan's code is unlicensed. This is MIT licensed.
- Simplified `package.json` a bit (an app template doesn't need to be exported)
- updated dependencies
- `package-lock.json` disabled (just a matter of taste...)

## Getting started

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Open `index.html` in browser.
