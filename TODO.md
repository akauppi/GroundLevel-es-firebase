# Todo

## Authentication

- [ ] Add Apple auth. See [extra information](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/apple?authuser=0)


## Tests

- [ ] Add tests?

## Requirements

- [ ] Coming to the site with a URL path, going through sign-in, one should land in the original intended path.

## Vue-router

- [ ] Add 404 route when otherwise done. 

   https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#caveat

   ```
       { path: '*', component: NotFoundComponent }
   ```

## Firebaseui

- [ ] It should depend directly on `@firebase/app` and `@firebase/auth`, instead of `firebase` - as it now does.
  - [ ] Track this (link here, if none, make one)
