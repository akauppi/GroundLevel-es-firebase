## vite - Custom imports map (alias) support

Mentioned on the README (0.6.0). 

This is *highly* welcome to us!!! 🎉🎊🍬

- Removed from Vite README (0.7.0)


## Support (of Vite and/or Vue 3.0 beta) from Chrome Vue development plugin

It's not detecting the setup.

Also the [beta channel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/ljjemllljcmogpfapbkkighbhhppjdbg) doesn't.

The [issues](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools/issues) do not mention anything about Vite or Vue 3 beta (28-Apr-20). When they do, add the direct link here.


## Bootstrap-Vue on Vue 3 (beta)

https://github.com/bootstrap-vue/bootstrap-vue/issues/5196


## Import maps (in browser)

https://wicg.github.io/import-maps/

State: no browser support?

>not a W3C Standard nor is it on the W3C Standards Track


## CSS standard support for nesting

https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting/

Once implemented in browsers, we don't need the `lang="scss"` any more.

Note: The ideology of the repo is to work close to what plain browsers offer. Thus, no SASS once we can get nesting without it.


## Vite 0.13.x has `process.env.NODE_ENV` catcha

Updating to it causes an error in console.

Try with next version.
