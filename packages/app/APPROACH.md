# Approach

*This doc is to collect a bit more about the approaches taken.*

## Avoid Cloud Function Callables

In the earlier times of the repo, Cloud Function Callables were used for a couple of things. However, they have one huge drawback: they are not available offline.

FireStore is (it caches data), so the approach is to use Cloud Functions only in the background and do all cloud-client data exchange via Firestore.

When, later, we need to do some more real time dataflow, it's either Firebase Realtime Database or a message bus like PubSub. In such a case, we might need to prepare offline awareness ourselves, into the app. `#speculative`

## No data store

Data is stored distributed, in the `Ref`s and `Reactive`s around the code. There did not seem to be a need for a centralized data store, Ã  la Vuex.

## Component naming convention

Vue.js normally uses `like-this` naming for its components.

We reserve that for externally imported web components, and have our own Vue components `LikeThis`.

Externally imported *Vue* components must be white listed.


## One `local` or two?

Both the Cypress tests (`npm test`) and `npm run dev` want to have local data and users for the emulation. They can work completely offline.

One could separate these, but there's no real benefit from doing so. Our approach is to keep the same local mode for both but differentiate in the data (and users) being loaded.

This might even provide benefits, because you are able to sign in as one of the Daltons, under `npm run dev`.
