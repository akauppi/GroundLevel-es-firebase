## Vue.observable usage for projects 

Someone with good understanding of Vue reactivity could have a look at  `src/mixins/myProjects.js` and `src/data/projects.js` and see, if better patterns are available.

We are trying to reach a pattern, where projects, and their inner data, fall effortlessly from Firebase to Vue.js application level, as observables or computed fields. 

<font color=red>The current code looks clumsy. If it even works. :P</font>

Vue.js 3 likely makes this simpler.

Could ask @Linus_Borg to have a look. He mentioned liking to crawl other people's code...?
