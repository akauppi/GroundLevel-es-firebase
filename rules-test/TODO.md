# Todo

## Use docker-compose

The Docker support is half-baked. Carry it further, maybe using docker-compose to bring in the local files.

Ideally, we'd love the Docker toolchain to be read-only to our local files & folders (and only the ones we explicitly pass to it).

+ And the tool to be a separate project that we don't need to carry in this one... ðŸ¥µ
