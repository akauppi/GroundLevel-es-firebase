## Speed up! ðŸš€

The overall test execution time is pretty slow.

|||
|---|---|
|`test:projects`|~1.50 s|
|`test:symbols`|~1.51 s|
|`test:invites`|~1.35 s|
|`test:all`|~5.8 .. 6.1 s|

During the execution, the CPU load is hardly noticable:

- [ ] Where does the calendar time go?
- [ ] Can we make these 5..10x faster?

```
$ time npm run test:all
...
real	0m10.375s
user	0m16.624s
sys	0m3.472s
```

## Use docker-compose

The Docker support is half-baked. Carry it further, maybe using docker-compose to bring in the local files.

Ideally, we'd love the Docker toolchain to be read-only to our local files & folders (and only the ones we explicitly pass to it).

+ And the tool to be a separate project that we don't need to carry in this one... ðŸ¥µ
