# Wishes for Firebase

Dear Firebase. You are awesome. If you ever run out of things to improve, hereÂ would be some ideas:

## Cloud Firestore

### Ability to insert "current server date" in the Firebase console

The dialog could have a "right now" or "server date" button, like the API allows a client to set a field to current date.

This would be even more valued, since it is not obvious to the user (me), whether I should fill in the UTC time, or a time in my local time zone. Having the suggested button would take away this consideration.
