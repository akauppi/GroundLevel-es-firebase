# Using Lighthouse

Here are some hints to use [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to better understand your web app's performance.

## Chrome DevTools

If you use Google Chrome, Lighthouse is already built in.

1. Open Chrome on the web page (either local, `npm run prod:serve` or a deployed app).
2. DevTools > `Lighthouse`
3. `Generate report`
