# Firebase Slim-down Diet

Firebase are [aware of](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/2241) (GitHub Issues #2241) gained weight. 

There's no justification for it. It must go. 

Set `createStats = true` in `rollup.config.prod.js`, to create a visualization of output sizes (this is disabled by default, since it takes some time).

e.g.

<font color=red>tbd. provide picture</font>


That is not *too bad* but it can be made better. We're interested to see advances in:

- Firebase `@exp` (experimental) packaging (hopefully fixes use as ES modules)
   - including authentication
