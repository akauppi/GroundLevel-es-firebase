# Wishes for Vue.js 3 (beta)

Dear Vue.

It's been nice to see you grow from Vue.js 2 to the blossoming that is Vue.js 3. You are doing many things right, so don't take this small feedback harshly.

It's just that.. being so beautiful, even a small annoyance stands out. Maybe you understand and something can be done about it. :)

Your fan.

The "issue" turned out to be nothing, at all.

Keeping the above for a while, since it feels beautiful. ðŸŒºðŸŒº
