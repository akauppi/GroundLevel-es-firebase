# Firebase libraries

Firebase has quite many server and client side JavaScript libraries, and their life cycles, quality etc. differ from each other.

Here is a list of the ones we've come across (all authored by Firebase), to help one see their relevance - or lack thereof. 



## Table

>Note: This table is a "best effort" and we aim to edit it, from time to time, when better real world knowledge of the various libraries is gained.

|npm|What is it?|When to use?|Open issues|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Client side**|

|**Between client and server sides (fuzzy and furry) ðŸ¦¥**|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;`firebase-functions-test`|Tools for making *unit tests* on Cloud Functions.|You want to unit test Cloud Functions within the `functions` folder. We don't use it. Making integration tests against local emulators may be a better approach.|[9](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-functions-test/issues) (23-Jul-20); oldest 8-Apr-2018|
|**Server side**|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;`firebase-admin`|Access to Firebase data, when running in a server-side node environment (locally emulated or online)|Don't use this client side.|[33](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-node/issues) (23-Jul-20); oldest 7-Jun-2017|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;`firebase-functions`|A library needed for implementing Cloud Functions||[30](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-functions/issues) (23-Jul-20); oldest 19-Jun-2018|
|**Developer tools**|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;`firebase-tools`|Command Line Interface (CLI)|Development and deployment; launching emulators. You need it.|[146](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues) (23-Jul-20); oldest 16-Dec-2015|

Note: There are also other, non-official packages that are not deployed by Firebase. **Stay clear of those!** It would be a good phishing attempt to make something people would install, by accident. **DO NOT TRUST THE NAMES**. It would be welcome if Firebase brought **all** their `npm` modules under the `@firebase` namespace, for simplifying this.

Why list the oldest issues?

Having old (say, over 6 months) issues in a repo is unmotivating for employees and causes a jungle of discussions to browse through for visitors. A healthy repo would have relatively fast turn-around times, issues being assigned to milestones or resolved as "nah, we won't do that".

Tracking a project's energy and roadmap is easier when old issues are not standing in the way.

That's why they are listed. Once they are <1 year in the past, we'll remove the listing.

### Where does the confusion rise from??

Entries like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62566957/cannot-call-firestore-from-unit-tests/62586875#62586875) show the "admin" library being used with tests (not run as a privileged environment, but just from the development environment command line).

Also [Unit testing of Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/unit-testing) (Firebase docs) is in this blurry middle kingdom.

It might work.

However, the author finds it way clearer to keep `firebase-admin` to the admin side (Cloud Functions run either online, or by the emulator) and client side (including tests) client side.

This means no function unit tests, but integration tests instead.
